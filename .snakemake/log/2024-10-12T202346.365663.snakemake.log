MissingOutputException in rule fastGWA_pre in file /home/wcy/data/UKB/eye_feature/code/Snakefile, line 35:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
